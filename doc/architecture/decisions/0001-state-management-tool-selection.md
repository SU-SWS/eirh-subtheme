# 1. State Management Tool Selection

Date: 2024-02-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to choose a state management tool for our Vite + React application to manage any possible complex state, including global application state, asynchronous data fetching, and UI interactions, for the Algolia Search and Filter facets.

## Considered Options

* React Context
* Redux Toolkit
* Recoil.js
* Zustand

## Decision

After evaluating several state management options, including Redux Toolkit, React Context, Zustand, and Recoil.js, we have decided to adopt Redux Toolkit as our state management tool.

## Consequences

By selecting Redux Toolkit as our state management tool, we anticipate the following consequences:

- Redux Toolkit's mature ecosystem and large community will provide ample resources and support for developers, facilitating a smoother transition and ongoing development process.

- Migrating directly to Redux Toolkit avoids potential future migrations from Recoil.js to Redux Toolkit, reducing the need for additional refactoring and ensuring a more straightforward development path.

- Redux Toolkit's advanced features, such as built-in Immer support for immutable updates and simplified Redux boilerplate, will enhance developer productivity and codebase maintainability from the outset.

- Aligning with Redux Toolkit aligns with established practices within the React ecosystem, contributing to the long-term maintainability and scalability of our application.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### React Context

* Good, integrated directly into React.
* Good, minimal setup â€” easy to set up and use.
* Good, enables reusable and composable components.
* Good, rovides custom providers and consumers.
* Bad, may not handle complex state interactions well.
* Bad, can lead to performance issues in large trees.

### Redux Toolkit

* Good, enforces a rigid data flow.
* Good, powerful debugging with Redux DevTools.
* Good, mature ecosystem with many tools available.
* Bad, requires writing additional code.
* Bad, steeper learning curve for unfamiliar users.
* Bad, may introduce additional overhead in large apps.

### Zustand
* Good, minimalist API for easy state management.
* Good, seamless integration with React.
* Good, lightweight and minimal dependencies.
* Good, allows concise state transformations.
* Bad, smaller ecosystem compared to Redux.
* Bad, may not handle complex state well.
* Bad, onbnoarding and learning curve when it comes to familiarizing team members with API

### Recoil.js
* Good, designed specifically for React applications.
* Good, requires less setup and code compared to Redux.
* Good, uses React's built-in mechanisms to optimize performance.
* Good, simplifies complex state interactions.
* Good, povides developer tools for debugging.
* Bad, new library with its own concepts.
* Bad, relatively new ecosystem and community in comparison to Redux.
